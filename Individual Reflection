Reflect on these questions: 

1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
2. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

Write a few sentences. Use them next week as starting point for next reflection. Notice any improvements and celebrate the progress you made!

- I want to learn the agile processes better, to understand more why it's important with user stories and having a backlog. I also want to get better at Unity.
- This team I've been to all meetings and did a short starting sprint to get the background to work. For next sprint I could maybe know more unity to be of more help.
