Reflect on these questions: 

1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
2. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

Write a few sentences. Use them next week as starting point for next reflection. Notice any improvements and celebrate the progress you made!

Sprint 1:

Erik Rudberg:
- I want to learn the agile processes better, to understand more why it's important with user stories and having a backlog. I also want to get better at Unity.
- This team I've been to all meetings and did a short starting sprint to get the background to work. For next sprint I could maybe know more unity to be of more help.
- Not available.

Gabriel Glänte:
- I want to learn how to integrate data into databases in a streamlined manner and in turn integrate such databases into various programs (in this case Unity). I also want to learn how to optimize task modularization with efficient teamwork and communication.
- My contribution this sprint was to decide what data to visualize and to create a primitive database. I can help by developing the database and integrate it with the program, and facilitate efficient and constructive meetings.
- This is the first sprint, no past reflection is available.

Hampus Jansson:
- I want to learn new programs and technologies like Unity, C++ aswell as creating a VR program. Understanding the agile process and improving my teamwork is also important.
- I've been to all meetings and contributed with my opinions. I created a script that enables you to switch scenes when clicking on an object.
- Not available.
