Reflect on these questions: 

1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
2. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

Write a few sentences. Use them next week as starting point for next reflection. Notice any improvements and celebrate the progress you made!
-------------------------------------
Sprint 1:

Elliot Ripa:
- I want to gain a deeper understanding of the scrum methodology, for example, how to properly utilise the "testing" column in an optimal manner.
- I initiated the repo, helped setting up GitHub for some team members, downloaded and imported a skybox as well as some terrain for the ground. I could attempt to familiarise myself with the VR aspect of development, to be able to work on that as well. Ensure that we are consistent with our methods on, for example commit messages and branches.
- None applicable.

Erik Rudberg:
- I want to learn the agile processes better, to understand more why it's important with user stories and having a backlog. I also want to get better at Unity.
- This team I've been to all meetings and did a short starting sprint to get the background to work. For next sprint I could maybe know more unity to be of more help.
- Not available. 

Didrik Tvedt:
- I would like to learn more about Unity and the possibilities of making more advanced scenes. I would also like to learn more about agile, the scrum board in particular.
- I have attended all meetings and disucssions. This sprint I helped with the base scene and getting the background to work. I can help in the coming sprints by familarizing myself more with Unity and help creating scenes.
- Not available

Gabriel Glänte:
- I want to learn how to integrate data into databases in a streamlined manner and in turn integrate such databases into various programs (in this case Unity). I also want to learn how to optimize task modularization with efficient teamwork and communication.
- My contribution this sprint was to decide what data to visualize and to create a primitive database. I can help by developing the database and integrate it with the program, and facilitate efficient and constructive meetings.
- This is the first sprint, no past reflection is available.

Hampus Jansson:
- I want to learn new programs and technologies like Unity, C++ aswell as creating a VR program. Understanding the agile process and improving my teamwork is also important.
- I've been to all meetings and contributed with my opinions. I created a script that enables you to switch scenes when clicking on an object.
- Not available.

Max Strömdal Eriksson:
- I would like to learn how to establish a replicatable a verstile procces in order to find my creative footing in unity.  
- I felt as it was difficult to be exatcly sure what to do, seeing as some areas of work reached other zones of work.
- Non applicable.

William Johansson:
- I want to learn how to optimally coordinate and cooperate in larger groups, I would also like to understand more about agile.
- My primary contribution during this sprint was coding scripts that enable others to make buttons that can be used in VR.
- Null referance error

Filip Eles:
- I would like to get more comfortable with the agile processes and accountabilities, while at the same time further imrpove my Unity knowledge.
- I took part in all meetings this sprint and I created a script to scale the cube. Next sprint I could work on improving this script.
- Not available

------------------------
Sprint 2

Erik Rudberg:
- I'm still eager to learn more about how to effectively use unity and also how to connect the scripts based in C#.
- This week I spent some time learning how to use Unity but also contributed by creating base scene alternatives to be used in the project. Next sprint I want to put everything together.
- We better used the user stories and issues connected to these.
