# dreamteam-project

The purpose of the dreamteam-project (Sometimes colloquially known as "The Visualisationer") is to show the more impressive differences present in the world, mostly between different countries.
By doing so, everyone can get a better understanding of the systems we find ourselves in, and grasp more firmly the places in which change may (and in some cases must) be done.
This is done using one of the most fundamental of three-dimensional objects, the cube. A shape with the same size across all its linearly independent axes which, when combined with each other,
can form complex shapes symbolising nearly anything, and in this case, slightly peeled cubes. Truly a task which will be appreciated by generations to come.
