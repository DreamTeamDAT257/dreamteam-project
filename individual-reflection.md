# Individual Reflections

### Reflect on these questions: 

1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
2. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

### Write a few sentences. Use them next week as starting point for next reflection. Notice any improvements and celebrate the progress you made!
-------------------------------------
#### Sprint 1:

Elliot Ripa:
- I want to gain a deeper understanding of the scrum methodology, for example, how to properly utilise the "testing" column in an optimal manner.
- I initiated the repo, helped setting up GitHub for some team members, downloaded and imported a skybox as well as some terrain for the ground. I could attempt to familiarise myself with the VR aspect of development, to be able to work on that as well. Ensure that we are consistent with our methods on, for example commit messages and branches.
- None applicable.

Erik Rudberg:
- I want to learn the agile processes better, to understand more why it's important with user stories and having a backlog. I also want to get better at Unity.
- This team I've been to all meetings and did a short starting sprint to get the background to work. For next sprint I could maybe know more unity to be of more help.
- Not available. 

Didrik Tvedt:
- I would like to learn more about Unity and the possibilities of making more advanced scenes. I would also like to learn more about agile, the scrum board in particular.
- I have attended all meetings and disucssions. This sprint I helped with the base scene and getting the background to work. I can help in the coming sprints by familarizing myself more with Unity and help creating scenes.
- Not available

Gabriel Glänte:
- I want to learn how to integrate data into databases in a streamlined manner and in turn integrate such databases into various programs (in this case Unity). I also want to learn how to optimize task modularization with efficient teamwork and communication.
- My contribution this sprint was to decide what data to visualize and to create a primitive database. I can help by developing the database and integrate it with the program, and facilitate efficient and constructive meetings.
- This is the first sprint, no past reflection is available.

Hampus Jansson:
- I want to learn new programs and technologies like Unity, C++ aswell as creating a VR program. Understanding the agile process and improving my teamwork is also important.
- I've been to all meetings and contributed with my opinions. I created a script that enables you to switch scenes when clicking on an object.
- Not available.

Max Strömdal Eriksson:
- I would like to learn how to establish a replicatable a verstile procces in order to find my creative footing in unity.  
- I felt as it was difficult to be exatcly sure what to do, seeing as some areas of work reached other zones of work.
- Non applicable.

William Johansson:
- I want to learn how to optimally coordinate and cooperate in larger groups, I would also like to understand more about agile.
- My primary contribution during this sprint was coding scripts that enable others to make buttons that can be used in VR.
- Null referance error

Filip Eles:
- I would like to get more comfortable with the agile processes and accountabilities, while at the same time further imrpove my Unity knowledge.
- I took part in all meetings this sprint and I created a script to scale the cube. Next sprint I could work on improving this script.
- Not available
------------------------
#### Sprint 2

Elliot Ripa:
- I would like to get better at working with Unity as well as how to integrate it with a database.
- I have worked on the inplementation of a database that is to be used in regards to storing our different data points, while it is not entirely completed, the main skeleton is in place. Simply keep working towards our goals and ensure that others do the same.
- We started making user stories to go with our tasks, which has made it easier to distribute the work-load as one can work more in terms of the story rather than individual goals.

Erik Rudberg:
- I'm still eager to learn more about how to effectively use unity and also how to connect the scripts based in C#.
- This week I spent some time learning how to use Unity but also contributed by creating base scene alternatives to be used in the project. Next sprint I want to put everything together.
- We better used the user stories and issues connected to these.

Didrik Tvedt:
- I feel like i have gotten a greater understandinng of Unity, but still want to learn more about how to connect the different components and implementing the database.
- I worked togheter at the same issues as Erik and Hampus, contributing with creating the base scenes to be used later in the project. In the next spring i hope to be able to help with the connection of the components so that we have a MVP ready.
- We have a better understadning of user stories and have implemented this. The meetings are more effective and we are starting to get a hang on how to work more agile.

Hampus Jansson:
- I still want to learn more about Unity. It is a program with many different features and takes a long time to fully learn.
- I have contributed by creating different scenes where we later will display the different data.
- We have implemented more user stories and gotten further with all of them.

Max Strömdal Eriksson
- I want to understand blender and the interaction systems in Unity better.
- I made concrete concept visuals for the UI in both the main scene and the visualization scenes. I furthermore started making the 3D in blender models necessary to make the UI compatible with VR.
- We made are more structured when it comes to user stories.

Gabriel Glänte
- I want to learn how to work with multiple programs and the infrastructure of a project in order to implement code efficiently in practice. 
- I contributed by co-developing code for reading and categorizing data from CSV files and inserting it into SQL tables. I can help the team to do better next sprint by developing an API to integrate the data with the Unity application.
- An improvement from last week is that we developed what we set out to do and managed to have more efficient meetings.

William Johansson:
- I want to learn both how one makes a user interface for vr and how databases can be used in unity 
- This week I worked on UI, specifically the UI presented to the user when they are in a visualization
- We added user stories and connected our issues to them

Filip Eles:
- I would like to learn more about connecting things in Unity, for example how to connect a database to a project
- This sprint I worked on improving the cube scaling, and came up with a method for creating the larger cube with better performance
- We began using user stories 

------------------------
#### Sprint 3

Elliot Ripa:
- How different Unity objects interact with each other. Find an optimal way to store data in a JSON file.
- We worked on the database aspect of the program, deciding to use one or more JSON files instead of a database to store data. We also managed to connect this to other scripts.
- We decided to put in more effort into our workflow being agile, as well as focusing more on reaching a minimum viable product.

Erik Rudberg:
- I'd like to learn more about how to put different scenes together.
- This sprint I worked on the database aspect of the project and collectively decided on in our database group to use JSON. We made it connectable with a script.
- We started striving more for an MVP, being more agile. 

Didrik Tvedt:
- I would like to learn more about coding i C and connecting the data so that we have an MVP
- I worked mostly on the scene which will be the MVP next week, tried dowing some research on how to connect data to the drop down table and worked alittle on this dropdown.
- We are getting close to an MVP and are getting better att dosumenting the progress

Gabriel Glänte
- I would like to learn more about the relationship between SQL and JSON and how to efficiently translate data between actionable formats.
- My contribution towards the team deliveries was to participate in the restructuring of the data management and development of a script in Unity which reads JSON-files with the data to be visualized by the cubes correctly.
- An improvement from last week is that we finished developing the last component necessary for integrating the data into the program.

William Johansson:
- I sttil want to learn how to best make user interface for vr and how databases work. 
- I continued working on UI this week, I finished what I had left from last week and added a simple aiming aid for the controllers.
- We put more emphasis on working agile.

Hampus Jansson:
- I still want to learn about Unity, agile working, etc. But also how to connect everything in a program, and how it comes together.
- I worked on the UI this week, I created dropdown menu's and connected them to the cubes so that user will be able to change the data being displayed.
- Working well in an agile way.

Max Strömdal Eriksson
- I want to get more into the weeds when it comes to more complex unity coding.
- I implemented the simpel UI
- We worked in a way that is more aligned with the agile procces, More specefically focusing on creating a MVP.

Filip Eles:
- I would like to get better at programming in pairs/smaller groups.
- In this sprint, I created a script for comparing two values/variables and scaling cubes accordingly, which will be used in the comparison "scene".
- We started focusing more on achieving an MVP.

------------------------
#### Sprint 4

Elliot Ripa:
- I'd like to get better at handling merge conflicts with git, and figuring out how maven works with java to handle dependencies.
- I've discovered a good lava library for creating and working with JSON objects, which I have used to get us closer to a proper "database" JSON file.
- We've reached the ever so elusive MVP.

Erik Rudberg:
- I'd like to become better at understanding how to most eficiently work together on big tasks and how the Scrum Master can ensure the efficiency of project. I also still want to get better at C#.
- Worked with the data sets and working on how to most efficiently transfer them into JSON.
- Created an MVP and also liked how we worked together this week for the bigger issues! 

Didrik Tvedt:
- Now tht we have an MVP i would like to learn more about connecting bigger data sets to the product so that we can create more visualizations.
- I worked with the dropdown menu, trying to make it return the string values so that we later can connect to the database. The UI team later changed the design, so this was no longer necessary. Furhter i worked with the "database team" to gather all the data in a csv file and formatted this after our needs.
- We have created a good MVP

Hampus Jansson:
- I still would like to learn the things i mentioned in earlier sprints better. I have also realised that splitting tasks up that depend on each other is difficult, and I would like to learn how to better communicate what you need for your code.
- In this sprint, I started off by trying to make the dropdown menus return the strings attached to them. We later came to the conclusion to create a new dropdown menu that could be implemented in VR, so we decided to drop the task. Afterwards I worked together with a team on databases. More specifically, we worked on a program that transfers CSV files to JSON files.
- We are still heavily focused on reaching another MVP. We started communicating better.


Max Strömdal Eriksson
- I would like to understand the Unity3D model eosystem better. I would also like to get more techincal knowhow. 
- I helped with the pliancy of the UI, I also made the redamentory Ui a bit better, helped develp the Ui for the indivudal scenes and also made The rvemped UI viable in Unity.
- We had more smaller meetings whcih I found helped us put together and MVP.

Gabriel Glänte
- I would like to learn how to optimize the balance between the need for every team member to understand what is going on in the project, and the need to distribute tasks efficiently so as much time as possible can be spent on productive work instead of unnecessary meetings. I also want to learn more about standard practices for aggregation and compilation of data in settings involving utilization of distributed data, instead of reinventing the wheel.
- My contribution towards the team deliveries has been to act as the week's scrum master and distribute tasks and communicate the overarching structure and state of the project, as well as structuring the database related work and participating in the coding process.
- An improvement from last week is that we got a fully functional MVP, and that communication in relation to the entire project structure has become more efficient.

Filip Eles:
- I would like to get better at connecting different parts of a project to get an interactable system.
- My focus this sprint was on connecting the comparison script with the UI to achieve an MVP and also some general improvements to the script. Next sprint I will most likely focus on connecting the script with the database.
- We have now created a sufficient MVP.

William Johansson:
- I would like to learn about how our database works and how to use it. 
- This week I created a drop down menu for selecting variants of visualizations and helped integrate the UI with the backend.
- We created a MVP.
